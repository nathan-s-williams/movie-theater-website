Description:

In this project you will create a web application for a movie theater.


Application requirements:

  1. List theaters for a zipcode.
  2. List movies for a theater.
  3. View description of a movie.
  4. List times for a movie.
  5. Purchase tickets for a movie time.

       Payment system is simulated (no real payment system).
       All card charges are approved.
  6. Validations:
       Zipcode - 5 digits
       Credit card - 16 digits



Infrastructure requirements:

   Web:  JSF preferred, JSP or Servlets permitted.
   Database: EJB/JPA preferred, JDBC permitted.

   The database should be named MovieDB.


Design:

The web interface is for you to design, and it should be easy to use and offer more than plain text for its appearance.  This should include the use of styles and images.  It should be suitable to demo to a company as an example of your work.


Code:

A working system should be created (with a simulated payment system).  The code should be easy to read, and comments should be used to guide the reader.  


Data:

You will need to provide your own data.  Wherever the user has a choice, at least 3 options should be provided.  For example, at least 3 zip codes, at least 3 theaters for each zip code, etc.

   2. Readme.txt     describes every web and Java file you created
   3. Team.txt       lists team members (if a team, else omit)
   4. Screens.zip    clearly labeled screen shots of the project from beginning to ticket purchase.
   5. SQL.sql        SQL script to create and load database
